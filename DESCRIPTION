Title: One-Sided Multinomial Probabilities
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Alexander Davis
Maintainer: Alexander Davis <ajdavis2@mdanderson.org>
Description: Implements multinomial CDF (P(N1<=n1, ..., Nk<=nk)) and tail probabilities (P(N1>n1, ..., Nk>nk)), as well as probabilities with both constraints (P(l1<N1<=u1, ..., lk<Nk<=uk)). Uses a method suggested by Bruce Levin (1981) <doi:10.1214/aos/1176345593>.
